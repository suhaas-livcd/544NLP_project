### Abstract
The primary goal of the paper is to convey the similarity between natural languages and protein sequences. We apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to abstract meaningful information from a protein structure in predicting thermal stability. Proteins are inherently similar to written languages where the structure encodes meaning. We exploit this inherent similarity by treating each sequence as a sentence and pre-processing the data respectively. Furthermore, we utilize various language based models to carry out thermal stability predictions.
